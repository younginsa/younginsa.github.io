								â€œHave itchy feet" That's how we call the
								people who can't settle down in a job or place
								of residence. "Yeokmasal" is a combination
								of Korean term "Yeokma" (horse; one of the
								essential transportation methods in the past)
								and "Sal" (bad luck). "Yeokgma" refers to
								the fate to rove around the world, and "Sal"
								refers to the evil spirits. People in Korea
								often say to the person who travels a lot that
								you are fated to wander over the world and
								cannot come back home. However, in the
								contemporary context of "Yeokmasal" refers
								to a fate of traveling all around the world and
								gaining various experience and meeting widea
								spectrum of people.
								</td>
								<td>Among the series of talisman for Yeokmasal,
								Wonhang-Bu is the one which wishes for the
								safety. Carrying this talisman on one's body
								makes one feels comfortable while traveling,
								avoiding illness and theft and wishes good luck
								on one's travel.</td>
