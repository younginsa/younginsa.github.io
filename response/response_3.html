        Privacy issues arise among cloud system these days seems a bit contradiction for me. Since technically cloud system is using and storing information to a server of cloud service providers, term 'privacy' seems to need to redefined under this condition. The real question for me is, are companies supporting cloud services deceiving users illegally or trying to reduce the realm of privacy, therefore, pushing users to agree on the condition whenever want to cloud system?

        'Captives of the Cloud: Part I' seems to reveal how the development of technique not only enriched convenience of the life but also the surveillance system. Fundamentally, even the days before in history like as map was important material to control and attack the city depends on the purpose, organized and wide-reaching technology has both pros and cons toward society, in this case, convenience and surveillance.

        From this perspective, arguments from 'Capitalism vs. Privacy' seems natural to follow up. What enriches and useful to an individual it also becomes same to the system. Therefore, in my point of view, defining the exact definition of privacy today and achieving area to support based on law and establishing the foundation to protect it is important.

        As described in 'Capitalism vs. Privacy', the strategy, disguising  act of collecting privacy as convenience and effectiveness, system went through in order to control and collect private data seemed smart that individual should well aware of it otherwise, the situation each person is allowing their privacy by themselves without noticing it will be caused as result.
