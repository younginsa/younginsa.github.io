        What is Code? For me, it is a sort of language. From this perspective, I wondered how the author would describe it and start with it. Basically, the author started from using third person's perspective who did not know much about coding but deeply relative to the field of it since the person was cooperating and paying for it. This worked for me as I am also the person who is not aware of the logic of coding, therefore, cannot distinguish which part of coding is more important from others.

        Coding is a language which speaks to various materials from website to machine with a purpose. Based on reading, coding seems to take boring and repetitive part of the task which human also can do, but since they can perform extremely fast in multitasking state, it becomes something. At this point coding with a machine, software, it could alternate work or even profession performed by the human. In this perspective, I thought "barrel of cash" often mentioned in the article was quite cheap for the cost of building a new system.

        Computer language I ever heard was Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. Could not assume how they are different by knowing names, it was surprising that Java and JavaScript had no common which contradicts that I expected. Programming language also evolves and lives life alike common language. It was interesting that differ from common linguistic language, programming language could interact with other languages by a virtual machine such as JVM. Though each of coding language was designed to fit on certain purpose, for me, it seems like someday we could have general common program language which speaks to most of the programming languages.

        Continued from the topic, my question was, how computer language could achieve a general standard?</p>
