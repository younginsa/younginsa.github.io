        Donna Haraway's criticism and assertion about definition of body and embodiment of female, especially in viewpoint of 'the persistent tendency among contemporary feminists from different 'moments' or 'conversations' in feminist' has limited its possibilities only as 'making current status better than before' rather than facing change of reality based on technology incorporating with capitalism therefore reconstructing definition toward female body, I deeply agree. I was impressed by author's perspective, which was exactly distinguishing what previous feminism had achieved and failed in an ironical way. Because previous feminism was pointing out female body as 'nature' which is intending to corporate in totalization as women, it lost its justification when global international technology united whole under rule of capitalism, where every aspect of human with intervention of capitalism as being, turned all kinds of totalization, integration into the suppression of individual. This was clearly illustrated when the classification of the race had no room to participate when feminism was insisting as the integrated union of women.

      The author is suggesting cyborg as the alternate solution of feminism, which is identities come across social, political boundaries and discrimination. Since technology digested reality into analogical text making separation of nature and artificial, living body and robotics vague, beings get able to disassemble and assemble, reproductive by code. Therefore, to follow up this sort of transition among society, we need to redefine of being and also nature. The way cyborg is suggested as an ideal identity to subvert traditional Western hierarchies, enforcement of sexual role as the unit seems like distopia yet inevitable.
