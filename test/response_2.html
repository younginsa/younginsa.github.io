        From Olia Lialina, Vernacular Web 1, I really enjoyed reading since I was able to recall my memories of my early experience of the web browser. I am born in late 80's, my computer class at elementary school taught us how to use a floppy disk. As described in the article, I learned from step by step, as same as the depth built in Vernacular Web 1. Following the article, I was suddenly curious where all the collections of icons or websites, things are now? Nowadays we better count on how much 'liks' or 'hearts' did post received rater than a number of visitors to a web page. As we show more dynamics by posting media on a website, arranging and designing 'my own web page' become a realm for a web designer or template. Also, I agree with author's point that trend of web aesthetic is returning to back the early 90's. For example, I can see many artist's websites are using minimalized design elements that they have listed their works with blue color linking titles at the left or using outstanding blinking moving icons with colorful layouts. Throughout reading this I felt that as contents and the way we arrange website alters the ways of people communicate via internet changes as well. What was first come? I wonder which way impacted the other one like did platform influenced the way we interact with each other? Or as generation makes difference in the way they communicate so web interface developed as well?

Second reading Alexander R. Galloway, Jodi’s Infrastructure, this sentence came to my mind 'A person may work “on” the digital or “within” it'. As a student majoring Digital Media, the term digital media was bit obscure for me. What mediums are they pointing out and basically, in which way do they use 'digital' so they distinguish 'digital media' from 'digital technology'?
The author's definition of context and content was also interesting since in my perspective it was hard to imagine creating something without context. The idea that content itself provides context, therefore, the concept of content, which is making lots of mediums materials into the same level of 'content' that is used as an ingredient for context, would be possibly appeared at modern era was very new to me. Also, Unicode used in a domain name that allows address with diverse language characters seems to be indeed international support. But at the same time, how should we built web language standard that users from all over the world could access to a certain webpage with the same view, and isn't it be more international support rather than supporting various language, I questioned myself.

From readings, I thought about interactive experience. Web experience became a special experience that is more than just searching through information. It has own world and rule operating inside. As a user, this reading broadens my horizon toward internet as space where language, interaction, relationships are consistently created and disappears and appear again. I felt potential for another paradigm starting from the internet in terms of communication.
